				<span class="span_cont">Allow me to present myself.</span>
				<p style="height:3px"></p>My name is Jeremy Leung, I am curently studying at Borough of Manhattan Community Colege (BMCC), CIS major.<br/>
					When I was young, I often looked up at the sky and wondered how things happened. At the age of 10 I knew I wanted to become a scientest (physicist). I wanted to figure out how things worked and blow things up with lasers at the same time. 
					After I got into college and studied a few years of calculus, and found out how many more years of math it would take, I decided it was enough and moved on to other things.<br/>
					Computer, what can't I say about them. They're everywhere, from the smartphone we have in our pockets to the laptops we uses for school and work. I remember an old qoute from 10 years ago when America's economy was so strong,"You must learn english if you want to succeed in life". Everywhere around the world English was being taught in schools to kids at an early age to prepare them. 
					And a couple of years ago you could say the same thing about China. Well now, It's computers, more and more schools around the country are teaching kids how to program from a younger age. The modern age is powered by computers, Try to imagine the past few years of your life, Your almost never leave your home without the smart phone, or how its almost required that you have a kaptop for school and work.
					 Hundreds of jops are being created every day around a field that involves computers. As computers become more and more intergrated with our livelyhood, its going to be tough when the computer breaks or stops working. It is going to feel like someone clicked pause on our lives. Learning how to program will really become benficial since you would be able to fix these issue on the spot when they happen.<br/>
					I believe I have made the right choice for my future path. I want to explor the world of physics through computers. with one program at a time.
